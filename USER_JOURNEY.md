- Server down → You still have your data

---

## 🔄 **Data Sync Across Devices**

### **If Server is Connected:**

**Scenario: You have phone AND laptop**

```
PHONE:
1. Enter SIM count → Save
   ↓ (auto syncs to server)

SERVER:
   (stores your data)
   ↓

LAPTOP:
2. Open app
3. App gets data from server
4. You see same entries! ✅
```

### **If Server is NOT Connected:**

```
PHONE:
1. Enter count → Save
2. Data stored locally on phone ✅
3. Works offline! ✅

LAPTOP:
1. Enter count → Save
2. Data stored locally on laptop ✅
3. Works offline! ✅

RESULT: Each device has its own copy
To sync: Export CSV from phone, import on laptop
(or email yourself the CSV)
```

## 🆘 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: App won't load**

```
Try this:
1. Refresh browser (F5 key)
   ↓ Still not working?
2. Clear browser cache
   - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Mac: Cmd+Shift+Delete
   - Then close & reopen browser
   ↓ Still not working?
3. Try a different browser
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - try them all
   ↓ Still not working?
4. Check internet connection
   - WiFi working? Try restarting router
   - Mobile data? Try toggling airplane mode
```

### **Problem: Data disappeared**

```
Possible reasons:
1. ❌ Browser cache was cleared
   → Solution: Check if you have CSV backup to restore
   
2. ❌ Wrong browser/device
   → Solution: Try the device/browser you originally used
   
3. ❌ Server data corrupted
   → Solution: Use CSV backup to re-enter data

PREVENTION:
→ Export CSV weekly!
→ Keep backups in cloud storage
→ Always assume local data can be lost
```

### **Problem: Can't copy/share CSV**

```
Try:
1. Manually select text
   - Click in data area
   - Select all (Ctrl+A)
   - Copy (Ctrl+C)
   - Paste into email/Excel
   
2. Take screenshot
   - Screenshot the data
   - Email the image
   - Manually type it later
   
3. Use different browser
   - Some browsers have copy/share issues
   - Try Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
```

### **Problem: Entries not syncing between devices**

```
This is OK! It's by design.

Reasons:
1. Server may be offline
   → Solution: Use CSV export to manually transfer
   
2. Different app instances
   → Solution: Close app on both devices, reopen

Workaround (manual sync):
1. Device A: Export CSV
2. Send CSV to Device B (email, Teams, etc.)
3. Device B: Manually enter data from CSV
```

### **Problem: Weekly total is wrong**

```
Check:
1. ✅ Did you save the entry? (Click SAVE button)
2. ✅ Is today's date correct?
3. ✅ Did numbers get cut off? (Check if full number appears)
4. ✅ Refresh the page (F5)

If still wrong:
→ Contact developer with screenshot
→ Include date and what you entered vs. what shows
```
